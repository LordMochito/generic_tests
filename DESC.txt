I just wrote a a README.txt in the zip, but in case they don't know any technology I used, let me describe it:

-. It's a maven project so to import it in eclipse, you only need to run : mvn eclipse:eclipse (equivalent for other IDEs)

-. I used BDD with Cucumber :https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jvm.

First of all, I wrote the features: 

src/acceptance-test/resources/com/codetest/acceptance/tests/interest_rate.feature

and later

src/acceptance-test/resources/com/codetest/acceptance/tests/override_special_rate.feature

with the acceptance criteria in them.

after that, I made an installation : mvn clean install that show up a skeleton for the junit test to cover all the scenarios 

, and then it's only make TDD cycles: red - green - refactor, in every layer : resource (REST layer) , service (Logic) and repositories(Data access) (I didn't need to implement the repositories, I used Spring-data).


-. TO run the tests :
		
		-    Either on command line :  mvn clean integration-test -Pacceptance for acceptance test and mvn clean test for unit tests
       - OR (this is specially useful in eclipse) run the class RunCukesTestIT as a JUNit Test
	
	this will launch a server and pass the acceptance tests.

-. I used the most of technologies proposed but the app server: I could make the test on tomcat as suggested, running the cargo maven plugin before acceptance tests , but I preferred to use an embedded Jetty. 

There are 2 reasons: First I wanted to create a POC with a single 'fat' jar running an embedded jetty server. The main idea is that it's a single executable : java -jar test.jar , so make easy the distribution to different environments and scalability 

and, in general, I prefer Jetty: it's very light in the startup and it doesn't need too memory. 


This is the tech stack:
